#I managed to do all of the shaders, albeit it was difficult. I ran into errors, but I copied down code and tried to carefully look into what is causing the bugs. THough I will say the one shader I had fun programming was the water shader, I combined both the Water and WaterScrolling shader to have the UV textures scroll along with the vertices moving up and down as a wave. I did try to add transparency to it but I failed, and it somehow desaturated the colors heavily for some reason.
